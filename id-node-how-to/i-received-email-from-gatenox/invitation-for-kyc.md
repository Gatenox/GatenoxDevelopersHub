# Invitation for KYC

### :information\_source: Why did I receive an invitation?

If you received an email from the Gatenox Hub inviting you to the KYC process, it means that a Gatenox User has asked you to provide your personal identification details using Gatenox Hub. Usually, the main reason for this request is to add your personal data to the corporate profile of the company, where you perform one of the following functions: director, shareholder or you are the UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner).

If you recognize the inviter, there are a few simple steps you need to do to add your personal data and share it with the inviter.

The KYC process involves the following steps to complete:

1. Personal data.
2. Residential address.
3. Identity document upload.

Please bear in mind that some fields may be already filled in for you by the inviter. In this case, your role is to review and correct the data if necessary.
