# I received an email from Gatenox

There are two main emails that Gatenox will send you:&#x20;



### Invitation for verification&#x20;

You receive an invitation email from Gatenox when the service which you are opening an account for or verifying your company, has invited you to create an account in Gatenox Hub as part of the onboarding process. The Gatenox Hub interface walks you through creating your corporate profile which you can share with the service via Gatenox in 1-click. Learn more here:[invitation-for-verification.md](invitation-for-verification.md "mention").



### Invitation for KYC

As an individual person, you are probably a director, UBO or individual shareholder in a company which has a corporate profile stored in the Gatenox Hub. In this case, you are asked to provide your identification details. Learn more here:[invitation-for-kyc.md](invitation-for-kyc.md "mention").
