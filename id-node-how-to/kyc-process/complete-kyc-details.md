# Complete KYC details

If you own individual identity data, the quickest way to complete the profile is to add it on your own.

To do it, click "Fill out the KYC details by yourself" instead of inviting someone to the KYC process.

Below you can find an example of completing individual data. The same screens will be presented in case of individual shareholders or UBOs. The data presented on the screen may differ - depending on the verifier requirements.
