# Invite for KYC

If you are not in possession of director / shareholder / UBO identity data, you can simply send an invitation for KYC to this person.

The person will receive an invitation email and can follow the step described here: [invitation-for-kyc.md](../i-received-email-from-gatenox/invitation-for-kyc.md "mention").

Meanwhile you can monitor their process on your side. The invitations can have different statuses.
