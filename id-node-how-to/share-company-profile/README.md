# Share company profile

If you have previously created your company profile on Gatenox Hub and would like to share it with another service provider, here are 3 simple steps:

1. Start onboarding with a service provider by putting it on "Current onboarding list".
2. Required data verification phase - before you submit data to the service provider we need to check if all data required by the service provider has been completed in your profile. Each service provider can ask for a different data set or can have additional questions specifically related to its business. For simplicity, the service provider picks up a set of fields required by its business and will be notified if there is any missing data. As you probably noticed, data is only entered once and used many times to onboard with different service providers!
3. Sharing your profile - after completing all required data there is a simple one click process of sharing your profile.
