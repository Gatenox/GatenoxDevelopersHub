Users can select a new UBO from the previously defined list or add a new one. Users can also edit an existing UBO by clicking on the pencil icon next to their name.

It is important to ensure that all UBOs are correctly identified and recorded, as this information may be required for regulatory compliance purposes.

#### Documents

In some cases, a business may be required to provide proof that someone is a UBO, such as when registering with a government agency, crypto crypto currency exchange or opening a bank account. Users can upload proof of being UBO on the [business-documents.md](../verification/business-documents.md "mention") tab, which is used to store important business documents. Users can upload digital copies of these documents for safekeeping and to provide to relevant parties upon request.
