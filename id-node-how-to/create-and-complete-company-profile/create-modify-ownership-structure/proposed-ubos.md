# Proposed UBOs

The "Proposed UBOs" screen lists the precalculated Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) based on the information provided about the shareholders. The list shows the names of the individuals or companies that are considered UBOs, as well as the percentage of shares they hold.

To mark an individual shareholder as a UBO, simply check the checkbox next to their name in the list. This will designate them as a UBO for the purposes of regulatory compliance.

If you need to add a new person as a UBO, you can do so on the next page by clicking the "Add New UBO" button. This will take you to a screen where you can enter the details of the new person and designate them as a UBO.
