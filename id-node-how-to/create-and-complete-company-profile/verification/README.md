The "Individuals" screen allows Business Owners to manage individuals' data attached to the company profile. The list of individuals shows the surname and given names along with the individual's role in the organization and birth data.

The Gatenox Hub offers 2 ways of collecting individual identity data:

1. Data can be completed by the business user creating or managing the company's profile. In this scenario, the business user needs to be in possession of all required identity data and photos of identity documents belonging to directors/shareholders/UBOs added to the company's structure.
2. Send an invitation to the individual who has been added to the company's structure to complete the data. This scenario offers the business user the option of inviting the individual to complete the identity data and upload document photos on their own.
