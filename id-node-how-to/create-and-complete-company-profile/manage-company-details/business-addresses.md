# Business Addresses

The "Business Addresses" screen is where users can enter and manage the various addresses associated with their company.

On this screen, users can update their company's address information as needed. They may need to make changes if they move to a new location or if they need to update their registered address with the government agency. Keeping this information up-to-date is important for legal and regulatory compliance, as well as for ensuring that customers and partners can easily find and contact the company.

#### Fields

#### Proof of company's address

In some cases, a business may be required to provide proof of their address, such as when registering with a government agency, crypto crypto currency exchange or opening a bank account. Users can upload proof of their business address on the [business-documents.md](../verification/business-documents.md "mention") tab, which is used to store important business documents. Users can upload digital copies of these documents for safekeeping and to provide to relevant parties upon request.
