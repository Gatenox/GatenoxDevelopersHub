# Create and complete company profile

The company profile is divided into 4 sections:

1. Business information: contains information about the company's name, registration number, and other relevant details. Learn more here: [manage-company-details](manage-company-details/ "mention").
2. Ownership structure: includes information about the company's ownership structure, such as shareholders and UBOs. Learn more here: [create-modify-ownership-structure](create-modify-ownership-structure/ "mention").
3. Verification: contains information about the verification status of the company, including documents and entities that need to be verified. Learn more here: [verification](verification/ "mention").
4. Summary: provides an overview of the company profile and any missing information that needs to be completed. Learn more here: [summary](summary/ "mention").

Your first company will be created during your first login process. If you would like to manage another company profile, please add it from the context menu, as described here: [add-new-company.md](add-new-company.md "mention").
