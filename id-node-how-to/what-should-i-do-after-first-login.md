Please follow the guide presented here: [add-new-company.md](create-and-complete-company-profile/add-new-company.md "mention").

In case you already have a company profile attached to your account, you will be automatically logged in to your account. If your account involves more than 1 profile, you can pick the one, that you want to work with.
