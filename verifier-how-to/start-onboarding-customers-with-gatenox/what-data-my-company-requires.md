# What data my company requires?

Each business requires different data sets. Gatenox users are creating their corporate profiles (in "Company profile" menu [user-journey](../../gatenox-guide/user-journey/ "mention")).

Your business may requires all fields or specific set of data. Those requirement are visible in "Settings" menu, on "Company account " tab, in "Verification" section.

Right now those data sets are configured via our consultants, so please contact mailto:sales@gatenox.com if you would like to change the default value.

We are working hard to allow this feature to be configured by our users directly.
