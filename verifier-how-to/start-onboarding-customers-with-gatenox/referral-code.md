# Referral code

Each verifier receives dedicated referral code which is used to quickly redirect the customer to Gatenox and start the onboarding process.

### Where is my referral code?

The referral code is generated automatically after a new company is created. It can be found in the "Settings" menu under the "Company information" tab.
