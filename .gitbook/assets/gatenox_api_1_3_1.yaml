                                Roman Abramovich is a Russian oligarch who has
                                long and close ties to Vladimir Putin. He has
                                had privileged access to the president, and has
                                maintained very good relations with him. This
                                connection with the Russian leader helped him to
                                maintain his considerable wealth. He is a major
                                shareholder of the steel group Evraz, which is
                                one of Russia’s largest taxpayers.

The inclusion of all names on one Consolidated\_List is to facilitate the implementation of the measures, and neither implies that all names are listed under one regime, nor that the criteria for listing specific names are the same. For each instance where the Security Council has decided to impose measures in response to a threat, a Security Council Committee manages the sanctions regime. Each sanctions committee established by the United Nations Security Council therefore publishes the names of individuals and entities listed in relation to that committee as well as information concerning the specific measures that apply to each listed name."

The inclusion of all names on one Consolidated\_List is to facilitate the implementation of the measures, and neither implies that all names are listed under one regime, nor that the criteria for listing specific names are the same. For each instance where the Security Council has decided to impose measures in response to a threat, a Security Council Committee manages the sanctions regime. Each sanctions committee established by the United Nations Security Council therefore publishes the names of individuals and entities listed in relation to that committee as well as information concerning the specific measures that apply to each listed name."

                              is a public ledger that records transactions that
                              are performed. This is achieved without any
                              trusted central authority as the maintenance of
                              the blockchain is performed by a network of
                              communicating nodes running the software. Network
                              nodes validate transactions, add them to their
                              copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these

                              financing of terrorism and proliferation. It is
                              increasingly difficult to distinguish from money
                              laundering activity due to the collusive conduct
                              of terrorist financiers and transnational
                              organized criminals, but it is typically
                              distinguished from money laundering on the grounds
                              that the sources of money laundering must be
                              criminal, whereas the sources of finance for
                              terrorism include donations from lawfully earning
                              income. The goal of money laundering is typically
                              a financial gain, while the goal of terrorism
                              financing is typically ideological activity.

                              multiple sites, geographies or institutions. All
                              participants within a network can have their own
                              identical copy of the ledger. Any changes to the
                              ledger are reflected in all copies in minutes, or
                              in some cases, seconds. The assets can be
                              financial, legal, physical or electronic. The

                            description: >-
                              a person of high public office who may be able to
                              influence the misappropriation of public funds
                              whilst in office, or the awarding of public
                              contracts. Include members of government, ruling
                              classes such as Presidents, Royalty, Ministers of
                              the Government and military and judiciary. The
                              families of PEPs, and their close business
                              associates, are also included due to the close
                              affinity and trust that they may enjoy in their
                              relationship, and which may lead to the PEP using
                              these relationships as ‘front’ or ‘informal’
                              nominees.

                            description: >-
                              a private key is a cryptographic code that
                              functions as a secret password that allows the
                              user to sign a cryptocurrency transaction and
                              transfer funds to another cryptocurrency address.
                              Using the private key proves ownership of
                              cryptocurrency.
                          - term: Sanctions
                            description: >-

                              prohibition on providing regulated services to the
                              subject of the sanction, and the requirement to
                              freeze and report any assets that are held to the
                              local jurisdiction sanctions administrator, such
                              as OFAC or HMT.

                            description: >-
                              a lower level of customer due diligence
                              verification that can be performed where there is
                              no, or a lesser, risk of money laundering.
                          - term: Trading platforms
                            description: >-
                              function as marketplaces, bringing together buyers
                              and sellers of virtual currencies by providing
                              them with a platform on which they can offer and
                              bid among themselves. In contrast to exchanges,
                              the trading platforms do not engage in the buying
                              and selling themselves. Some trading platforms
                              give their customers the option of locating
                              potential customers nearby. Examples include
                              LocalBitcoins.com and Mycelium Local Trader.
                          - term: Transaction Fee
                            description: >-
                              Is earned by miners when a transaction is
                              completed. The minimum transaction fee required is
                              determined by the "size" (kilobytes) of the
                              transaction data. Most small transactions require
                              a fee of about 0.0001 BTC and transactions with
                              larger fees are given priority to be added to the
                              block, so they are usually confirmed faster than
                              transactions with low fees.

                             - any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary, expectancy or consequential damages, including lost profits, lost revenues, loss of opportunity or business interruption, whether or not such damages are foreseeable, or
                             - any third-party claims (whether based in statute, contract, tort or otherwise).

                        The vast majority of trading companies are private
                        companies limited by shares. There are over two million
                        such companies registered at Companies House. A private
                        company limited by shares must have the word "Limited"
                        or "Ltd" at the end of its name. The main advantage of
                        trading through a limited company is to have limited
                        liability. Many private companies are very small. There
                        is no minimum capital requirement for a private company
                        and it is commonly less than £100. Approximately 90% of
                        private companies are small or medium sized companies
                        which means that they can file modified (i.e.
                        simplified) accounts at Companies House, rather than
                        full accounts. A private company may not offer shares or
                        debentures to the public: CA 2006, sec755, only a public
                        company (PLC) may do so.

                      The vast majority of trading companies are private
                      companies limited by shares. There are over two million
                      such companies registered at Companies House. A private
                      company limited by shares must have the word "Limited" or
                      "Ltd" at the end of its name. The main advantage of
                      trading through a limited company is to have limited
                      liability. Many private companies are very small. There is
                      no minimum capital requirement for a private company and
                      it is commonly less than £100. Approximately 90% of
                      private companies are small or medium sized companies
                      which means that they can file modified (i.e. simplified)
                      accounts at Companies House, rather than full accounts. A
                      private company may not offer shares or debentures to the
                      public: CA 2006, sec755, only a public company (PLC) may
                      do so.
