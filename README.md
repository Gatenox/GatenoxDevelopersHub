# Introduction

This wiki explains the Gatenox Hub interface and possible usage scenarios.

The application caters to two roles:

* **User** who, while going through the Corporate KYC process, onboards to other companies
* **Verifier** who reviews submitted Corporate KYC applications. As a **Verifier**, you are also a **User**, so you have access both to Verifier and User functionalities. If you'd like to quickly jump into User or Verifier's shoes and see the potential possibilities, check out the [videos-tutorials.md](sandbox/videos-tutorials.md "mention").

To save you time and maximize your user experience, we have populated your profile with sample company data. For BETA testing, you don't have to worry about filling in these necessary data. Feel free to edit them if you want to fill in the data yourself.

The company profile provided of the box consists of:

* **Company details data** (Jurisdiction, Company Name, Company Registration Number, Date of Incorporation, Company Type, Brand Name, Proof of Incorporation, Registered Address, Office Address, Proof of Office Address, Industry)
* **One Company Director** (and UBO) with KYC data
* **One Individual Shareholder** (the same person as the Director)
* **One Corporate Shareholder**
