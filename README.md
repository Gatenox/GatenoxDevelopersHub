# Guide to the Gatenox Hub

This document explains the Gatenox Hub interface and possible usage scenarios. 

The application caters to two roles:
* **User** who, while going through the Corporate KYC process, onboards to other companies
* **Verifier** who reviews submitted Corporate KYC applications.
As a **Verifier**, you are also a **User**, so you have access both to Verifier and User functionalities. If you'd like to quickly jump into User or Verifier's shoes and see the potential possibilities, check out the [Tutorial Video for both roles](https://beta.gatenox.com/gatenox-beta-video-explainer). 

## Introduction
To save you time and maximize your user experience, we have populated your profile with sample company data. For BETA testing, you don't have to worry about filling in these necessary data. Feel free to edit them if you want to get the experience of filling the data in yourself.
 
The company profile you get out of the box consists of:
* **Company details data** (Jurisdiction, Company Name, Company Registration Number, Date of Incorporation, Company Type, Brand Name, Proof of Incorporation, Registered Address, Office Address, Proof of Office Address, Industry)
* **One Company Director** (and UBO) with KYC data
* **One Individual Shareholder** (the same person as the Director)
* **One Corporate Shareholder**

# Onboarding Process (User Journey)
A significant part of the onboarding process is filling in all your company data required by the company you want to onboard to.

In the Gatenox Hub, the data collection process has been divided into 3 main parts, ie Company Details, Directors, and Company Structure (including UBOs).

Each part has an easy-to-use wizard that guides you throughout the process.

## Creating new company

To create a new company profile you need to open the context menu in the upper right corner and click on the “Add company” link.

<img src="./Images/settings_manage.png">

You will see an “Add new company” screen. In order to facilitate the process of creating a new company profile (entering selected data for you), you must specify exactly what company you mean by entering the jurisdiction and number.

<img src="./Images/company_add.png">

Now you can use the “Find your company” button to search for the name of your company. The result will be displayed in the “Company name” field. In case your company will not be found, you can enter “Company name” manually and press the “Continue” button. If the company was not found, then we will not be able to facilitate the process for you.

Now you can press the “Continue” button to go through the company setup wizard. The “Company details” preparation screen will be displayed.

# Verification Process (Verifier Journey)

To review applications, click on the Verifications tab and select one of the applications in the list.

<img src="./Images/applic.png">

From this screen, you can also send a verification invitation to another company. As soon as the other party accepts your invitation to the Corporate KYC process, the application will appear in the mentioned list.

<img src="./Images/appli_invitation.png">

## Review Process
Each application is divided into 6 main parts:
* **Company Details** - displays all details related to company incorporation data, addresses, etc.
* **Directors** - displays all details related to company directors (including required KYC information)
* **UBOs** - displays all details related to company UBOs (including required KYC information)
* **Company Structure** - displays all shareholders (this part is connected with the company structure graph that you can see at the top of the review page)
* **Identified Issues** - displays all identified potential issues, e.g. presence of company entities or individuals on sanction, PEP or criminal lists
* **Assessment** - section where you can accept or reject the application and include summary notes

Before the mentioned sections are displayed, a summary of any identified potential issues will appear at the top of the page e.g. presence of company entities or individuals on sanction, PEP or criminal lists in **a red section**. 

<img src="./Images/review_issues.png">

If no potential issues are found, a green section will be displayed at the top of the page. 

<img src="./Images/review_issues2.png">

In addition, you can view the whole structure of the company in the form of a **fully interactive graph** (it is possible to open the graph in a new browser tab).

<img src="./Images/review_graph.png">

After having an overview of the company's structure, you can proceed to the process of viewing the data.

**Identified issues**

**Assessment**

<img src="./Images/review_assesment.png">

## Extended verification

The basic sanctions check included as a default involves verification of individuals and companies on the internal sanctions list. This currently  only includes the OFAC database.

If you need to verify individuals and companies against a myriad of sanction lists, PEP, and criminal watchlists, you can buy additional search credits by selecting an entity on directors, UBOS and company structure tabs. They will be added to the entity's verification basket on the right side of the webpage. 

<img src="./Images/entities_verification.png">

If you have sufficient credits, when you press the “Verify” button, additional verification will be performed and the results will be presented in the same manner as internal checks.

<img src="./Images/entities_verification_result.png">

# Settings

Settings can be accessed using the "Settings" tab on the side menu pane on the left or by clicking on the "Manage your account" button in the upper right corner.
