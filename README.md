# Introduction

This wiki explains the Gatenox Hub interface and possible usage scenarios.

The application caters to two roles:

* **Business User** who, while going through the Corporate KYC process in **ID Node** part of Gatenox HUB, onboards to other companies.&#x20;
* **Compliance Officer / Compliance Team** who reviews submitted Corporate KYC applications in **Compliance Cloud** part of Gatenox HUB. As a **Compliance Officer / Compliance Team**, you are also a **Business User**, so you have access both to Compliance Cloud and ID Node functionalities. If you'd like to quickly jump into the Business User or Compliance Officer's shoes and see the potential possibilities, check out the [videos-tutorials.md](sandbox/videos-tutorials.md "mention").
