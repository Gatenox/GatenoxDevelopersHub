# Introduction

This wiki explains the Gatenox Hub interface and possible usage scenarios.

The application caters to two roles:

* **User** who, while going through the Corporate KYC process in **ID Node** part of Gatenox HUB, onboards to other companies.&#x20;
* **Verifier** who reviews submitted Corporate KYC applications in **Compliance Cloud** part of Gatenox HUB. As a **Verifier**, you are also a **User**, so you have access both to Verifier and User functionalities. If you'd like to quickly jump into User or Verifier's shoes and see the potential possibilities, check out the [videos-tutorials.md](sandbox/videos-tutorials.md "mention").
