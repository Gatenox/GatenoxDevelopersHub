# Create and complete company profile

The company profile is divided into 3 sections:

1. Company details - learn more here: [edit-company-details](edit-company-details/ "mention").
2. Directors - learn more here: [add-edit-directors.md](add-edit-directors.md "mention").
3. Company structure - learn more here: [create-modify-company-structure.md](create-modify-company-structure.md "mention").

Your first company will be created during your first login process. If you would like to manage another company profile, please add it from context menu, as described here: [add-new-company.md](add-new-company.md "mention").&#x20;
