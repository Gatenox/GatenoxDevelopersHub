# UBOs

The UBOs definition screen involves pre-calculated list of UBOs. The calculation of UBOs is made based on company structure prepared in previous step ([shareholders-structure.md](shareholders-structure.md "mention")).&#x20;

### UBOs

If you need to know who is UBO, please click on "Ultimate Beneficiary Owner" link.

The calculation made by us is only a helper for you. On the list you can select ( checkbox on the right side of the list), which one of your individual shareholders are real UBOs. In some situation you will not be able to place your UBO on the company structure prepared on previous step. In this case, you can manually add UBO to current list by clicking on the "Add UBO" button.

You can select a person from previous added to you company profile individuals or add new one by clicking on "Enter manually" link. In both cases add also a percentage of share controlled by the UBO.&#x20;

### Justification

If you added UBO manually, you might be asked to provide justification. After clicking to the "Done" button, the following screen will be displayed.

Please provide relevant explanation and press "Continue" button - you will be redirected to shareholders verification screen.
