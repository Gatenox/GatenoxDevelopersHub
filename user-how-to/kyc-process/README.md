# KYC process

The Gatenox Hub offers 2 ways of providing individuals identity data:

1. Complete all data by the business user, who is creating or managing the company's profile. In this scenario the business user needs to be in possession of all required identity data and photos of identity documents belonging to directors / shareholders / UBOs added to the company's structure.

2. Send the invitation to complete data to the person, who has been added to the company's structure. This scenario offers the business user the possibility of inviting the individual to complete the identity data and upload document photos on his own.
