# Complete required company data

If your profile requires additional information requested by Gatenox Partner, the following information will be displayed on "Your company profile" screen.

You will get information about the profile section, which needs to be completed. Click on the "Get started". You will be redirected to wizard, which will guide you through the company profile to enter required data.

**Please notice that required data are marked with a red star and "required" label next to the field name.**

On the screen below "Date of incorporation" and "Company type" are required, but "Brand name" is not required (requested by Partner), so you do not need to fill all fields, if you would like to quickly go through wizard and complete only required data.

Nevertheless, we encourage you to enter all the data to save your time in the future - these may be data required by other Gatenox Partners and in this case you will not have to go back to completing the company profile.

If you have completed all data required by Partner let's share your profile: [share-my-profile.md](share-my-profile.md "mention").
