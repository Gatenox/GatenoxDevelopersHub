# Start onboarding

You can add a service provider (also called as "Gatenox Partners") in two ways.

The service provider, which allow business users to send company profile (documents and data) using Gatenox have 2 methods to invite business users to apply using Gatenox Hub:

1. The Partner can send you an invitation email with the link. More information about invitation email can be found here: [invitation-for-verification.md](../i-received-email-from-gatenox/invitation-for-verification.md "mention").
2. The Partner can implement a button on the service webpage.

In both cases after clicking on the link, you will be redirected to the Gatenox Hub login / sign up page and after the successful login / sign up, the partner's name will be added to your "Onboarding list". Your "Onboarding list" is presented on the right side of the "You company profile" screen.

Depending on your actual profile completeness level, there are 2 situations, which may occur:

1. Your profile has all data required by Partner - in this case, you can automatically send data to Partner. This situation usually happens during second or later onboarding, when most of the data has been already entered. Learn more here: [share-my-profile.md](share-my-profile.md "mention").
2. Your profile requires additional information - in this case, you are asked to complete your company profile. This situation usually happens after a new account was created or during the first onboarding. Do not worry - we are here to guide you through the process.
