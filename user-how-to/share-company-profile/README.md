# Share company profile

You have created your company profile on Gatenox Hub and you would like to use it to provide information about your company to your future service provider? It is as easy as a piece of cake!

We have split the sharing your data process info 3 phases:

1. Start onboarding with a service provider - this is the indicial state of the process, when you pick up a service provider and put it on "Current onboarding list".
2. Required data verification phase - before you submit data to the service provider we need to check if all data required by service provider has been completed in your profile. Each service provider can ask for a different data set or can have additional questions specifically related to its business. To avoid ping-pong of questions and answers the service provider picks up a set of fields required by its business and after you start onboarding with the service provider the verification is performed to inform you which data is missing. As you probably noticed data is only entered once, and used plenty of times to onboard with different service providers!
3. Sharing your profile - after completing all required data there is a simple one click process of sharing your profile.
