# Review details

## Introduction

Each application is divided into 6 main parts:

* **Company Details** - displays all details related to company incorporation data, addresses, etc.
* **Directors** - displays all details related to company directors (including required KYC information)
* **UBOs** - displays all details related to company UBOs (including required KYC information)
* **Company Structure** - displays all shareholders (this part is connected with the company structure graph that you can see at the top of the review page)
* **Identified Issues** - displays all identified potential issues, e.g. presence of company entities or individuals on sanction, PEP or criminal lists
* **Assessment** - section where you can accept or reject the application and include summary notes

## Review summary

Before the mentioned sections are displayed, a summary of any identified potential issues will appear at the top of the page e.g. presence of company entities or individuals on sanction, PEP or criminal lists in **a red section**.
