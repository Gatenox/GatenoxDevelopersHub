# Example data - overview

To save you time and maximize your user experience, we have populated your profile with sample company data. For testing, you don't have to worry about filling in these necessary data. Feel free to edit them if you want to fill in the data yourself.

The company profile provided of the box consists of:

* **Company details data** (Jurisdiction, Company Name, Company Registration Number, Date of Incorporation, Company Type, Brand Name, Proof of Incorporation, Registered Address, Office Address, Proof of Office Address, Industry)
* **One Company Director** (and UBO) with KYC data
* **One Individual Shareholder** (the same person as the Director)
* **One Corporate Shareholder**

Here you can find a description of sample data that has been provided to user and verifier profile on the sandbox environment.

1. Log in to the application using the login information you received in the email.
2.  After logging in, you will hit your company profile screen. We have prepared a profile of the company named **Verifier LTD** for you. As you can see in the following screenshot, the profile contains several sections related to the Verifier LTD company details (_Company Details, Directors, Documents, UBOs, Company Structure_) and _Message Panel_, and _Other Gatenox Partners_.
