# Business representatives

The "Business Representatives" section displays a list of individuals related to the company, including directors and other key personnel / representatives. The information presented alongside each person is tailored to the user's specific data set requirements.

Additionally, users have the option to conduct enhanced due diligence on each person listed within this section ([entities-verification.md](entities-verification.md "mention")).

Next to each field there is a menu allowing Compliance Officer to start conversation with User - ask questions about the review data. Please find our more here: [in-app-communication-tool.md](../in-app-communication-tool.md "mention").
