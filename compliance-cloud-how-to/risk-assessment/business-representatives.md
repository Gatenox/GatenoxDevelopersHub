# Business representatives

The "Business Representatives" section displays a list of individuals related to the company, including directors and other key personnel/representatives. The information presented alongside each person is tailored to the user's specific data set requirements.

Compliance Officer can also find this result of sanctions screening next to the business representative name.

Additionally, users have the option to conduct enhanced due diligence on each person listed within this section ([entities-verification.md](entities-verification.md "mention")).

Next to each field, there is a menu allowing the Compliance Officer to start a conversation with the Business User - and ask questions about the review data. Please find our more here: [in-app-communication-tool.md](in-app-communication-tool.md "mention").
