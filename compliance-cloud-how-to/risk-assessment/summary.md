# Summary

A <mark style="color:red;">red-colored</mark> section located at the top of the review screen will display a summary of any potential issues that have been identified, such as the presence of company entities or individuals on sanctions, PEP, or criminal lists.

{% hint style="info" %}
The visibility of this section is contingent upon the outcome of sanctions screening. If nothing is found during the screening process, the section will be hidden from view.
{% endhint %}

In case you have configured the review process with QA status ( [#verification-services-overview](../cases-management/#verification-services-overview "mention") ), the comment form QA will also occur at the top of the screen.
