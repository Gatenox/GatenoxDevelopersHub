# Summary

A <mark style="color:red;">red-colored</mark> section located at the top of the review screen will display a summary of any potential issues that have been identified, such as the presence of company entities or individuals on sanctions, PEP, or criminal lists.

{% hint style="info" %}
The visibility of this section is contingent upon the outcome of sanctions screening. If nothing is found during the screening process, the section will be hidden from the view.
{% endhint %}
