# Company structure

The "Company Structure" section presents a list of both individual and corporate shareholders associated with the company under review. Users can access additional details of each entity in the company structure by scrolling down below the graph. The information presented alongside each entity is tailored to the user's specific data set requirements.

Furthermore, users have the option to conduct enhanced due diligence on each individual and corporate shareholder listed within this section ([entities-verification.md](entities-verification.md "mention")).
