# Risk assessment

### Risk assessment screen structure

The risk assessment screen comprises several distinct sections. The top bar features a "Back" button, along with the name, number, and jurisdiction of the reviewed company.

Additionally for corporate verifications, a "Verify company" checkbox is present, enabling the execution of enhanced due diligence by cross-checking with extended sanctions lists. For individuals "Verify person" checkbox is available.

The top bar also displays pertinent details regarding the user's plan and available credits (more information: [company-information.md](../../general-settings/company-information.md "mention")).

Further, the top bar includes links to essential features, including notifications, settings, and context changes.&#x20;

The main component of the review screen displays the data set, as per the user's defined requirements ([what-data-my-company-requires.md](../start-onboarding-customers-with-gatenox/what-data-my-company-requires.md "mention")).

The left side of the screen contains links to various review sections, along with a small version of the company structure graph for added reference and a list of previous cases for this company. The list is organized as links so the Compliance Officer can easily open the case view in a separate window.&#x20;
