# UBOs

The "UBOs" section provides a list of the ultimate beneficial owners of the company under review. The information displayed alongside each person is presented in accordance with the user's specific data set requirements.

Compliance Officer can also find this result of sanctions screening next to the business representative name.

Furthermore, users can conduct enhanced due diligence on each person listed within this section ([entities-verification.md](entities-verification.md "mention")).

Next to each field, there is a menu allowing the Compliance Officer to start a conversation with the Business User and ask questions about the review data. Please find our more here: [in-app-communication-tool.md](in-app-communication-tool.md "mention").
