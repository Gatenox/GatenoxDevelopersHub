# Company details

### Company details section

The "Company Details" section is an essential component of the review process, containing a wealth of pertinent information related to the company under review. This section comprises details such as company registration data, including any registration numbers, incorporation dates, and legal entity types.

In addition, the section includes information on the company's registered addresses and other contact information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and website links.

Moreover, the "Company Details" section may contain documents related to the company, such as  shareholder agreements or proof of address. All of this information serves to provide a comprehensive picture of the company under review and forms a crucial part of the overall assessment process.

Next to each field there is a menu allowing Compliance Officer to start conversation with User - ask questions about the review data. Please find our more here: [in-app-communication-tool.md](../in-app-communication-tool.md "mention").
