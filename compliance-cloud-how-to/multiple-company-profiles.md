#### Managing Multiple Company Profiles in Gatenox Hub

The Gatenox Hub offers a seamless way to manage different scopes of data by allowing users to link multiple company profiles to a single personal account. These profiles are neatly organized in alphabetical order for easy navigation, with the currently active profile prominently displayed at the top.

To switch between your company profiles, simply access the menu in the upper right corner of the Gatenox Hub interface. You can use the search field to navigate between companies associated to your account.
