# Check crypto addresses

The "Check Crypto Addresses" feature is a security and compliance tool that allows users to verify the risk level associated with cryptocurrency addresses by cross-referencing them against databases of known risk indicators and reports of illicit activity.

We are analyzing blockchain addresses to detect potential exposure to illicit activities like fraud, money laundering, or connections with sanctioned entities.
