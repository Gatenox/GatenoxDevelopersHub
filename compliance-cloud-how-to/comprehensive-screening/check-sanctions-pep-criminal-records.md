# Check sanctions / PEP / criminal records

The "Check Sanctions / PEP / Criminal Records" feature is a robust compliance tool designed to help users perform due diligence and risk assessments by screening entities against various sanctions, PEP, and criminal records databases. This service is essential for financial institutions, businesses, and other entities seeking to comply with international regulations and prevent engaging in relationships with high-risk or legally exposed individuals or companies.

Important notes

* Make sure the information you enter is accurate to ensure the accuracy of the search results.
* Always review potential matches carefully and investigate any hits further before taking any action.
* The standard search is generally faster but covers fewer databases. Use it for routine checks and when entities are expected to appear in the major sanctions lists.
* The premium service is recommended for high-risk individuals, companies with global exposure, or when comprehensive due diligence is required.
* After creating a new request, you will be redirected back to the list. All the filters will be clear and you can find your newly requested report at the top.
