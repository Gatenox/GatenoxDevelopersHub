# Start onboarding customers with Gatenox

There are a few simple steps to start verification of your customers using Gatenox Hub:

1. Add information about your company [about-your-company.md](about-your-company.md "mention").
2. Setup your required data (optional) [what-data-my-company-requires.md](what-data-my-company-requires.md "mention")
3. Configure your referral code [referral-code.md](referral-code.md "mention").
4. Send an invitation to review for corporate client:  [send-invitation-for-review.md](send-invitation-for-review.md "mention").
5. Send an invitation to review for individuals: [send-invitation-for-review-1.md](send-invitation-for-review-1.md "mention").
6. Add the "Apply via Gatenox" button or link to your portal/webpage [apply-via-gatenox.md](apply-via-gatenox.md "mention").

Alternatively, Gatenox Hub serves as an initial tool for screening against sanctions, PEP (Politically Exposed Persons), and criminal records. Additionally, we provide blockchain analytics to facilitate requests for crypto address verification reports, enabling a comprehensive assessment of associated risks. These features are offered via Gatenox API.
