# What data my company requires?

Each business requires different data sets.&#x20;

Your business may requires all fields or specific set of data. Those requirement are visible in "Settings" menu, on "Company information" tab, in "Verification" section.

Right now those data sets are configured via our consultants, so please contact [sales@gatenox.com](mailto:sales@gatenox.com) if you would like to change the default values.

We are working hard to allow this feature to be configured by Users directly.
