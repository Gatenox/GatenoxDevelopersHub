# What data my company requires?

Each business requires different data sets.&#x20;

Your business may require all fields or a specific set of data. Those requirements are visible in the "Settings" menu, on the "Company Information" tab, and in the "Verification's settings and info" section.

Right now those data sets are configured via our consultants, so please contact [sales@gatenox.com](mailto:sales@gatenox.com) if you would like to change the default values.

We are working hard to allow this feature to be configured by Users directly.
