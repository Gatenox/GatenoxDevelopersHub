# Rate limiting

{% hint style="info" %}
The Gatenox API is currently in **beta** version. This means you should not rely on it's availability, and that it may change without prior warning.
{% endhint %}

Currently, there are no rate limits for our beta version, which means that you can use Gatenox API to its full potential without worrying about restrictions. However, as we continue to refine and improve our service, we may implement rate limits to ensure that all users have fair access to our platform.
