# API reference

{% hint style="info" %}
The Gatenox API is currently in **beta** version. This means you should not rely on its availability, and that it may change without prior warning.
{% endhint %}

Gatenox API offers you the ability to:

* check the status and result of incoming corporate and individual verifications
* get verification data including company details, business representatives' data, shareholders' structure, and all documents attached for verification.

{% hint style="info" %}
For some endpoints, you may need your verifierID identificator. You can check it on the Settings page on the Company Infomation tab ([company-information.md](../../general-settings/company-information.md "mention")).
{% endhint %}
