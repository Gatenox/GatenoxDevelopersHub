### Welcome to the Gatenox API!

Gatenox API is a powerful tool that allows you to easily access and manage verification data. With our API, you can quickly check the status and result of incoming verifications, giving you the ability to make informed decisions in real time.

In addition to status and result information, Gatenox API provides access to detailed verification data, including company details, business representatives' data, shareholders structure, and all documents attached to the verification. This information is invaluable for making informed decisions and mitigating risk.

Our API is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Whether you're a developer building a new application or a business owner looking for a streamlined way to manage verification data, Gatenox API has you covered.

So why wait? Start using Gatenox API today and experience the power of our verification data services for yourself!

### Authentication

Authentication is provided through a Bearer Token, which ensures that only authorized users have access to the API. This added layer of security helps to protect sensitive data and ensure that your information remains secure.&#x20;

### Rate limits

Gatenox API is designed with scalability in mind, which means that you can use it to process large amounts of verification data quickly and efficiently. However, to ensure that our service remains available to all users, we do have rate limits in place.

Currently, there are no rate limits for our beta version, which means that you can use Gatenox API to its full potential without worrying about restrictions. However, as we continue to refine and improve our service, we may implement rate limits to ensure that all users have fair access to our platform.
